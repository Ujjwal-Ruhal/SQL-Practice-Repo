Applications of SQL Self Join
SQL Self Join is widely used in different scenarios, such as:

Hierarchical Data: Representing organizational structures like employee–manager, category–subcategory or parent–child relationships.
Finding Relationships: Identifying relationships within the same table, for example linking friends in a social network or mapping task dependencies.
Data Comparison: Comparing rows within same table, such as salaries of employees in same department.
Detecting Duplicates: Finding duplicate records in a table by joining it with itself on duplicate criteria.
Sequential Data Analysis: Comparing current rows with previous or next rows, useful for analyzing trends in sales or time-series data.
