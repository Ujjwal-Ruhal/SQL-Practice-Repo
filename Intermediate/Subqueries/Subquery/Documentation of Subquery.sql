/*
SQL Subquery
A subquery in SQL is a query nested inside another SQL query. It allows complex filtering, aggregation and data manipulation by using the result of one query inside another. 
They are an essential tool when we need to perform operations like:
*/
/*
Filtering: selecting rows based on conditions from another query.
Aggregating: applying functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG with dynamic conditions.
Updating: modifying data using values from other tables.
Deleting: removing rows based on criteria from another query.
