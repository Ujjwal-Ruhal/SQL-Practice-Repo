/*
SQL Correlated Subqueries
A correlated subquery is a subquery that depends on values from the outer query. Unlike a regular (non-correlated) subquery, it is evaluated once for every row in the outer query. This makes correlated subqueries dynamic and highly useful for solving complex database problems like row-by-row comparisons, filtering, and conditional updates.

Executes once for each row of the outer query.
Subquery uses values from the outer query.
Ideal for ranking, row-specific calculations, and conditional logic
